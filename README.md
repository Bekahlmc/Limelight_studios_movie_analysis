## Business Problem and Understanding

**Stakeholders:** C-Suite leaders; Founder, CEO, CFO, COO.

As a respected member of the entertainment industry, our founder and sole investor is eager to make themselves a name in the Movie industry as a producer of valuable stories while maintaining a profit. Since reputation is important, we not only want to focus on gross, but popularity as well since we want our movies to be memorable. We are excited to work with established creators and provide them a platform to thrive both within their primary genre and branch out to diversify their portfolio and talents.

To reiterate, since we want the opportunity to continue to create in the future, we will focus on gross profit and evaluate how it correlates to other factors such as popularity.

There is a focus on a wide range of audiences and world wide reach so for the first phase of this initative, we will be evaluating world-wide grossing data as well as including all languages and regions in our analysis. In future expansion, we will want to evaluate such specifics however

Lastly, we will narrow down our search to years post the millenium as that is the start of the most recent era within movie history. In addition, our data limits our timeline not to 2023 but to 2019. This is another consideration for future endevours.

**Preliminary Questions include:**

- *What genres make sense to invest based on profit and popularity among viewers?*
- *Which measure of central tendency makes sense as a reference for starting production budget for each identified genre?*
- *With which creators do we want to initate relationships within identified genres?*

Databases used and explored: 
- <a href = "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/">Box Office Mojo</a>
- <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>
- <a href = "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>
- <a href = "https://www.themoviedb.org/">TheMovieDB</a>
- <a href = "https://www.the-numbers.com/">TheNumbers</a>

**The goal:** Identify genres, production budget per genre, and creators in which to invest in phase 1. We want to both focus on profit and viewability based on popularity among viewers. As well as analyze which creators with whom to form relationships as we launch our first productions.

## The Datasets
We began with five original datasets, each containing substantial amounts of data. 
- One of these datasets originated from the website Rotten Tomatoes. Although we were keen on utilizing the review data within this dataset, it presented a challenge as 80% of the box-office data   was missing â€“ a critical aspect considering profit is one of Limelight Studio's primary concerns. Furthermore, it lacked movie title data, whcih hindered our ability to merge it with other movie-grossing dataframes.
- Another significant dataset was a comprehensive IMDB SQL database, with tables detailing movie directors, writers, other industry professionals, movie particulars, and reviews. Despite lacking profit information, we successfully extracted data on movie creators, enabling us to make recommendations to Limelight Studios.
- Additionally, we used a dataset from themoviedb.org (TMDB) featuring movie reviews, popularity metrics, genres, release dates, and other relevant details.
- In our analysis, we extensively utilized data from www.the-numbers.com, particularly for comparing worldwide gross figures across movies.
- However, the dataset sourced from www.boxofficemojo.com was not useful to us due to its significant gaps in foreign gross data, which we need given Limelight Studios' emphasis on global reach.

**Ultimately, our analysis relied on data from TMDB, IMDB's directors, writers, and movie review tables, and budget/grossing information sourced from www.the-numbers.com.**

All mentioned datasets can additionally be found in the `Data` folder. 

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Despite narrowing down our datasets, we still had a large volume of data sourced from three different sources. Since we knew we needed to merge data from the different sources, we thoroughly cleaned and processed the data for consistency and to seamlessly join. The following outlines the main steps in our data preparation process:

1. **TMDB dataframe** - In this dataframe, the column `genre_ids` contained only numerical values. We replaced these numerical representations with their corresponding genre labels. Subsequently, we cleaned the genre strings and made a new column named `primary_genre` to accommodate movies with multiple genres. Next, we addressed NaNs (missing values) and hidden NaNs by dropping rows where these occurred, as they were in columns critical for our analysis.
2. **Budget data** - Although there were no missing values in this dataframe, we did need to clean the format of several columns, including `worldwide_gross`, `domestic_gross`, `production_budget`, and `release_date`. Additionally, we created a `release_year` column to facilitate convenient filtering.
3. **IMDB tables** - In the directors and writers IMDB dataframes, we extracted pertinent columns from the persons and movies tables, such as `birth_year` and `death_year`. Initially, we removed rows with a `death_year` value to retain only individuals who are still alive. Subsequently, we eliminated the `birth_year` and `death_year` columns. We then proceeded to drop irrelevant columns and NaNs.
4. **Merging TMDB and Budget** - We merged the TMDB and budget dataframes to compare grossing information with `popularity`, `vote_average`, and `primary_genre`. To facilitate the merge, we aimed to merge on the movie title. Thus, we adjusted the column names accordingly for ease of reference and created a unique identifier column by combining `movie_title` and `release_date`. Subsequently, we cleaned the data and removed any duplicate values.

## Analysis and Findings

We first analyzed our dataframe containing TMDB and budget information. We wanted to test the correlation of several different variables, including `popularity`, `vote_average`, and `production_budget` to `worldwide_gross`. These are our results: 

#### Correlation Tests
- `worldwide_gross` vs `popularity`: With a correlation coefficient (r) of ~.64, we can confirm that the more popular the movie, the higher the gross profit with a 'moderate' positive correlation.

- `worldwide_gross` vs `vote_average`: With a r at ~.29, there is a negligible correlation, we can confirm that the `vote_average` is not a good signifier of `worldwide_gross` profits and should not be considered.

- `worldwide_gross` vs `production_budget`: There is a high positive correlation with r at ~.8, we can confirm that a higher `production_budget` is a good predicter of higher `worldwide_gross` profits.

#### Genre Analysis
For our genre analysis, we conducted an ANOVA test to assess whether `worldwide_gross` varies based on genre. It's important to note that this test isn't perfect, as the sample sizes for the different genres vary. However, it provides an initial insight into whether further investigation into this relationship is warranted. Our results indicate that there *is* a statistical difference in gross between genres.
